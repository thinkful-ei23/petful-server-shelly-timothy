## Deployment

https://petful-server-side.herokuapp.com

The backend for this app includes a queue algorithm to present information First In Last Out (FILO).

Routes enter via '/api' and provide data for '/dog' or '/cat'

Get request responds with a single JSON object that includes the dog or cat's image, a description, name, sex, age, and breed and require no API KEY or other authentication.

Delete responds with a 200 status and no JSON object when the pet is adopted.

At this time, there are no other routes provided.
